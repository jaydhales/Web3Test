# Web3bridge IX Assessment Test

### Languages/ Tools used: 
- Html
- Css
- Javascript
- Vercel
- Github

### What I did 
- Created a simple biodata form that uses javascript for custom validations.
- Input displays corresponding errors to the user once the submit button is clicked and each error clears while focusing on their individual input.
- Added regex to verify email and phone number's length(11 digits without country code i.e 08145678901).
- If all inputs are filled correctly, the form will display a success alert then clear.
